# dwr_116py
D-Link DWR-116 from Cyfrowy Polsat (mode 8) Keygen

Much thanks to Selenium on hashkiller forums for implementing the commander binary into an emulator\
Without it would not have been possible to debug this and extract the keygen\
This is mode 5,8 and 11 from the lte3301 /usr/sbin/commander binary\
Used on at least the D-Link DWR-116 from Cyfrowy Polsat (mode 8) other LTE units possible

Usage: python3 dwr_116.py c412f55e5b40
